# Ceraunus

This library is a lightweight trading framework written in Rust. It focuses on Binance USDⓈ-M futures and may extend to other exchanges/instruments later. 

The development of Ceraunus follows [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) principles as far as I can. It does not aim at doing everything like [`barter-rs`](https://github.com/barter-rs/barter-rs), but a pocketnife for my everyday use.
